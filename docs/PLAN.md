# cover-flow-carousel

This component should allow users to navigate through a collection of items in a visually appealing and interactive manner, similar to the cover flow effect seen in macOS versions prior to Catalina.

You find the design for mobile, tablet and destop in the file [examples-mobile-tablet-desktop.pgn](examples-mobile-tablet-desktop.png).

The implementation should only use Bootstrap 5.3, HTML, CSS and vanilla ES6 JavaScript.
